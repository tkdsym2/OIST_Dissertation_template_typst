              repertoire of motor memories. For example, through experience, we
              become proficient at manipulating a large range of objects with
              distinct dynamical properties. However, it is unknown what
              principle underlies how our continuous stream of sensorimotor
              experience is segmented into separate memories and how we adapt
              and use this growing repertoire. Here we develop a theory of motor
              learning based on the key principle that memory creation, updating
              and expression are all controlled by a single
              computation-contextual inference. Our theory reveals that
              adaptation can arise both by creating and updating memories
              (proper learning) and by changing how existing memories are
              differentially expressed (apparent learning). This insight enables
              us to account for key features of motor learning that had no
              unified explanation: spontaneous recovery1, savings2, anterograde
              interference3, how environmental consistency affects learning
              rate4,5 and the distinction between explicit and implicit
              learning6. Critically, our theory also predicts new
              phenomena-evoked recovery and context-dependent single-trial
              learning-which we confirm experimentally. These results suggest
              that contextual inference, rather than classical single-context
              mechanisms1,4,7-9, is the key principle underlying how a diverse
              set of experiences is reflected in our motor behaviour.",

               controlling one’s own actions, and through them, external events.
               The sense of agency is a byproduct of human movements and also
               greatly shapes perception and behaviour. Furthermore, research on
               human–machine interaction has highlighted the importance of the
               sense of agency in joint control between humans and automated
               systems. In this Review, we first provide an overview of how the
               sense of agency influences human perception and how the
               perceptual effects of the sense of agency are used to measure
               this subjective feeling. Second, we review how the sense of
               agency modulates behaviour, including action selection,
               goal-directed actions, and social cognition. Third, we introduce
               theoretical and neural accounts of how the sense of agency
               arises. Finally, we explain how the sense of agency applies to
               human–machine interactions, an area that is rapidly developing
               and increasingly linked to daily life. The sense of agency refers
               to the feeling of controlling one’s own actions and associated
               external events. In this Review, Wen and Imamizu describe how the
               sense of agency shapes human perception and behaviour and
               summarize how the sense of agency is altered in human–machine
               interactions.",

               supports interactions in which a single user can interact with
               multiple bodies in multiple spaces. Recent teleoperation
               technologies have allowed a user controlling multiple objects
               simultaneously, but at the same time, it also exhibited a
               significant challenge, which can be attributed to the high
               cognitive load caused by switching and recogning various
               spaces/perspectives repeatedly and instantly. To tackle this
               challenge, by taking advantage of pre-attentive visual cues for
               users’ simultaneous information processing, we designed and
               evaluated a new user interface, called Shadow Clones, that
               projects self-body information in unattended areas for increasing
               the awareness of body-space relationships and allowing users to
               seamlessly switch across different visual perspectives from
               avatars or remote robots. We then explored the proposed approach
               through a simple visual reaching task with a performance
               evaluation in terms of task completion time and success rate. The
               results showed superior performance when compared with a
               condition that presents no projections of users’ body movements
               in unattended areas. We conclude by discussing possible
               mechanisms of this enhancement as well as two potential scenarios
               using the shadow clones approach, including new entertainment
               content for virtual reality e-sports and multiple robot
               teleoperation such as in a construction site or a disaster site,
